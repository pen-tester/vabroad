                    October, I spent my last week in Southern France exploring 
                    the cities of the Gard Department. The city of Nimes where 
                    there are numerous historic Roman sites. Uzes, the First Duchy 
                    in France. And the Pont du Gard, an aqueduct that is considered 
                    to be one of the tallest pieces of roman architecture. But 
                    my love of gardens caused me to search out any mention of 
                    beautiful villas and gardens that would be available for viewing 
                    while in this area. The dry Mediterranean climate of southern 
                    part of France is not always conducive to ornate gardens. 
                    But I found one. A private villa and garden located in the 
                    vicinity of the Pont du Gard. There were only a few references 
                    to the castle, Chateau St Privat, on the internet. So, when 
                    I arrived at Uzes, I called and made an appointment to visit 
                    the castle.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I entered 
                    the castle, I was met immediately by a small bird like woman 
                    with red hair and hard piercing eyes. She paced the floor, 
                    impatiently waiting for me.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;How did 
                    you find out about my chateau?&#8221; she demands as she stares 
                    directly into my eyes.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;I was doing 
                    research on the internet about the gardens of Southern France 
                    and saw mention of Chateau St Privat.&#8221;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I continue with 
                    my explanation about how I had found information regarding 
                    her garden on the internet and then visited the Pont du Gard 
                    making inquiries at the tourist office. The tourism office 
                    had finally provided me with the information on how to contact 
                    her for permission to visit the gardens.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Of course: 
                    the internet.&#8221; She says and seems satisfied and turns 
                    away.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Come 
                    with me!&#8221; She commands and disappears through the castle 
                    hallways.<img src="/blog/PICT1693.jpg" width="250" align="right"></font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our destination 
                    is a long garden room with elaborate wrought iron doors that 
                    open onto the 1st terrace of the gardens. The afternoon sun 
                    brightens and warms the room. Red Persian carpets, yellow 
                    Louis XV furniture and red marble tables fill the room. The 
                    walls are covered with ornate hand carved wooden paneling. 
                    In spite of the French antiques, the room feels lived in. 
                    Off to one side is a wicker chair, tilted upside down while 
                    it is being mended. Papers are scattered on top of the tables 
                    and a small Westie terrier runs in circles around my feet.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wrought iron 
                    doors open onto an enormous terraced garden. The park like 
                    setting of the upper terrace extends outward with an unobstructed 
                    view of a large grey statute of Neptune reclining in the middle 
                    of a pond. Ancient yew and cypress trees form a backdrop with 
                    a canopy that perfectly frames Neptune. Along the perimeter 
                    of the upper garden are a series of statues gazing back towards 
                    the castle and Neptune. Their origins seem almost lost in 
                    history as many aspect of the garden date back to the 1600s.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we walk through 
                    the garden, Madame Fenwick begins to tell me about her childhood 
                    and growing up at the castle with her grandfather. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;When I was 
                    a child, the castle, the surrounding acreage and vineyard 
                    were a part of our country estate. Our main residence was 
                    located in Paris, but we would visit during holidays and the 
                    summer. My grandfather, who was Director of the Paris Opera, 
                    would invite the artists and musicians from the opera to come 
                    to the castle to enjoy a break from the city.&#8221;</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="/blog/PICT1690sm.jpg" width="360" height="261" align="left">Her 
                    grandfather, Jacques Rouch&eacute;, had married into one of 
                    the oldest French perfume families, JT Piver. In 1896, he 
                    became the Administrator for the perfume company and patented 
                    Amyl salicylate, the first synthesized aroma chemical. He 
                    was also one of the driving forces behind the push to make 
                    the JT Piver name an international brand. After his success 
                    in the perfume business, he became Director of the Paris Opera. 
                    His dedication to rejuvenating the floundering Paris Opera 
                    caused him to become known as &#8220;The man who saved the 
                    Paris Opera.&#8221; He remained the Director from 1914 to 
                    1944.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I glance 
                    back towards the castle, the wrought iron doors almost disappear 
                    into the massive facade of the chateau. They are no longer 
                    the main focal point, rather the castle with its huge ochre 
                    colored exterior and towers now command all the attention. 
                    Even Neptune fades to an inconsequential dot in the landscape. 
                    No sounds erupt except for the singing of the birds. Off to 
                    the far right, the Gardon River forms a border along the edge 
                    of the gardens and it snakes its way through the forest. Occasionally 
                    you catch a glimpse of ka<img src="/blog/PICT1697sm.jpg" width="360" height="314" align="right">yakers 
                    as they float down the river.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We descend to the 
                    lower garden through a series of stairs. The sidewalk extends 
                    perpendicular to the retaining wall leading away from the 
                    castle to the farthest point in the garden; where the greenhouse 
                    and a tall ornate fountain meet to form the border of the 
                    property. Urns with red geraniums create a border along the 
                    sidewalk leading to the rear of the garden. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Madame Fenwick 
                    and I climb the stairs back to the upper level of the garden. 
                    She returns to the castle while I remain to take photos. After 
                    several minutes, she returns and asks if I would enjoy viewing 
                    the interior of the castle.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The castle sits 
                    on the site of an ancient roman villa. Its Roman connection 
                    has always been maintained through the centuries. Three km 
                    from the castle is the Pont du Gard, an ancient roman aqueduct 
                    that is registered as a Unesco world heritage site. Throughout 
                    the ages, the aqueduct and the chateau were owned and maintained 
                    by the same family. However, the cost for the maintenance 
                    of the aqueduct became unmanageable and eventually, in the 
                    early 1900&#8217;s, the aqueduct was sold to the French government.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most 
                    famous room in the castle is where Richelieu signed the Peace 
                    Treaty of Ales in 1629. In the center of the room is a massive 
                    hand carved wooden table and chairs with leather backing that 
                    has been passed down through the centuries to each successive 
                    owner. On the wall is a portrait of King Louis XIII of France. 
                    Richelieu was considered the first Prime Minister of France 
                    and helped Louis XIII consolidate his power during the 17th 
                    century. The walls of the room are painted a dark blood red. 
                    The wooden slate ceiling is very typical of French castles 
                    during this period.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For over 
                    400 years the castle was the owned by the noble Faret family. 
                    They were one of many Protestants who inhabited this region. 
                    The growing influence of Protestants along with the Huguenots 
                    antagonized the Catholic population resulting in series of 
                    wars that attempted to prevent the Protestant religion from 
                    gaining prominence. Chateau St. Privat was the site where 
                    the Peace of Ales was signed in 1629 between Richelieu and 
                    the Protestants. The treaty granted religious tolerance to 
                    the Protestants.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we near the 
                    end of the tour, Madame Fenwick steps into a small modern 
                    sitting room with a miniature refrigerator and offers me a 
                    chair. She opens a bottle of French Rose wine and pours us 
                    both, a glass. As we relax, she continues talking about her 
                    grandfather and her friends, the Duchess of Uzes and Viscount 
                    of Mogere. She drapes herself in a in a reclining position, 
                    with her arm draped over the back of the upright chair and 
                    her legs point outward at an angle. At first I stare, wondering 
                    what she is doing. Then I realize; she is posing like the 
                    old fashioned movie stars; gracefully draping them self over 
                    chair.</font><br>
