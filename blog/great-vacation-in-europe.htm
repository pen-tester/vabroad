                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 -Notify 
                    your bank that you will be out of the country. Let them know 
                    that you will be on vacation in a specific country and the 
                    actual dates. Sometimes a bank will flag international charges 
                    as suspicious. You could be having the time of your life in 
                    France; when you try to pay a restaurant bill with your credit 
                    card and have the card declined. So be sure to notify your 
                    bank. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 – Exchange 
                    Rates. The best exchange rates can be found through your credit 
                    card. Many people think that you should purchase your currency 
                    from a local bank before you travel. Or they exchange their 
                    USD at the airport. But usually these places charge some of 
                    the highest exchange rates and you are not getting a good 
                    value. Instead, just use your credit card. You can always 
                    get a cash advance from an ATM in Europe or pay for your purchases 
                    direct on your Visa. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 – Research 
                    your hotel before making a reservation. Hotel websites can 
                    be misleading; but you can get information from other travelers 
                    by reading the reviews on TripAdvisor.com. Some of their reviews 
                    will tell you exactly what they liked or did not like about 
                    the hotel. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 - Where 
                    to dine. Stay away from restaurants that have tour buses parked 
                    outside. It is best to find a restaurant that is patronized 
                    by the locals. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 – Best 
                    time of year to travel. Spring and autumn are considered the 
                    shoulder season. The rates in the hotels are less expensive. 
                    The cities are not choked with tourists. And the weather is 
                    cooler. The shoulder season is the best time to travel.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 6 – Pack 
                    light. Lugging a suitcase around is not fun. Pack items that 
                    can be easily hand washed and will dry easily. Limit your 
                    luggage. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 – Travel 
                    Shoes. Only take comfortable shoes to wear. You will do so 
                    much walking, visiting museums, villas, gardens, restaurants 
                    that you’re your feet can easily develop blisters if you do 
                    not have the proper footwear.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 8 – Electrical 
                    Outlets. European cities have a voltage that is almost twice 
                    the voltage in the USA. If you do not have a good adapter, 
                    you can burn up your equipment; whether it is a laptop or 
                    video camera. There are voltage adapters that you can purchase 
                    here in the USA. However, it is better to get one in Europe. 
                    Most major hotels will have a voltage adapter available for 
                    their clientele. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 – Rent 
                    a car locally. It is so much easier to see the sights when 
                    you rent a car. You can gain more of an exposure to the local 
                    culture and travel off the beaten path.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 10 – 
                    Planning your trip. Customize your trip to include destinations 
                    that emphasize one of your hobbies. You do not always need 
                    to see the main tourist attractions. What are your hobbies; 
                    wine, food, gardens, needlepoint or music? Try to find locales 
                    that specialize in one of your hobbies and can offer you a 
                    unique experience. </font></p>
