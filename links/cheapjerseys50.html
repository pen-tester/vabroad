<p>I m not sure what the fuss is about Cam, we went into a noisy, hostile environment and came up with a win. Also, we had some key drops on some precision passes so he s not the problem. Also, we are switching out 3 backs so no one can get in rhythm to help the running game. I like Stewart but with him back in the lineup it makes it difficult for everyone as far as the game flow. Cam is fine and will be fine this game, but when you have dropped passes it hurts a qb confidence. The defense however has been a bright spot but the offense with its ball control allows the defense to stay fresh to come out and attack, we are currently balanced.

<p>It was an odd week around the NFL in Week 10 as both the winless teams, the Jaguars and Buccaneers, each earned their first win of the season and the Vikings picked up their second. Several of the upset wins of the week came at the expense of teams in the hunt for the postseason, shaking things up some with seven weeks of regular season football left to play.

<p>FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP)  Rex Ryan bolted out of his office the moment he heard Ed Reed was cut.He wanted to make sure general manager John Idzik knew one of his favorite players was available for the New York Jets to pursue."It's only a rumor that I pulled a hamstring," Ryan said, grinning. "That's not true."The Jets signed the nine-time Pro Bowl safety Thursday, bringing one of the NFL's greatest playmaking defensive players to a secondary on a defense that ranks 24th against the pass. The 35-year-old Reed was released Tuesday by Houston, cleared waivers Wednesday and joined less than 24 hours later."John had a big smile on his face," Ryan said about the Jets' GM. "I think he anticipated it, but he had already beaten me to the punch. He had already set it in motion with our scouts."Reed joined his new Jets teammates on the practice field wearing a green No. 22 jersey; his familiar No. 20 is currently worn by cornerback Kyle Wilson. Reed laughed when he was asked if he thinks he's got anything left."I don't think I'd be here if they didn't think that," he said after his first practice with the Jets. "I know what I know. I know how I feel and I know what I've put in my offseason workouts. I'm ready to go. You'll see."You guys can be the judge of it."The Jets released outside linebacker Ricky Sapp to make room on the roster for Reed.Ryan and defensive coordinator Dennis Thurman coached Reed for eight years in Baltimore. Reed has always been a favorite of Ryan, who once labeled him the greatest safety to play the game. While his physical skills no longer make him one of the game's elite players, Reed will be able to serve as a leader in the secondary and help bring along young safeties Antonio Allen, Jaiquawn Jarrett and Josh Bush."This had nothing to do with sentiment," Ryan said. "We believe that Ed will be a great signing for us and he's going to help this football team, without question."Reed said New England also showed interest, as well as one other team, but everything seemed right about coming to the Jets."It just fits," he said. "I know the system. Rex was like, 'Go ahead and let's see what you've got.'"The fact that the Jets (5-4) are in the playoff hunt was also a plus."That's a huge factor," Reed said. "It was a huge factor in playing this year, in general, being with a team that was going to contend and be in the playoffs."There's a good chance Reed will be ready to play Sunday at Buffalo, at least in certain situations, and it is a low-risk, high-reward situation for the Jets."We've had some issues with the deep ball," Ryan said. "Let them throw it there now."Reed would like to start, of course, but added that he's fine with whatever the coaches want him to do, including playing in dime packages or special teams."They had a good thing going before I came," Reed said. "I don't plan on rocking the boat."That was a bit of an issue in Houston, as Reed missed the Texans' first two games after offseason hip surgery and was relegated to a backup role, making just 16 tackles with no interceptions.He was unhappy about not starting after signing a three-year, $15 million deal in the offseason following 11 years in Baltimore. Reed also criticized the team for being outplayed and outcoached after the Texans' seventh straight loss last Sunday."To put it simple for you," Reed said, "it wasn't a good fit."Texans defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said Thursday that Reed's criticism was not why he was released, but rather because the team's younger players were performing well and Reed wasn't getting a lot of playing time.Phillips laughed when he was asked if the Texans thought they were going to get more out of Reed when they signed him."Yeah, I think that's probably an understatement," Phillips said. "We all thought he was going to be J.J. Watt in the secondary. And things didn't work out that way."Reed, who won a Super Bowl last season with the Ravens, was the NFL's top defensive player in 2004. In 11-plus seasons, the ball-hawking Reed has 61 interceptions, including seven returned for touchdowns. He's a five-time first-team All-Pro who also holds the NFL record with 1,541 yards on interception returns. His nine career postseason interceptions, including one in the Ravens' Super Bowl win, tie him for the league mark.Reed said recent criticism of him has come as a result of being held to higher standards than most safeties."I created that monster, and I've been blessed to create that monster," he said. "I love it."Reed had a whirlwind 24 hours, which began with him working out in Georgia when he cleared waivers around 4 p.m. Wednesday. Less than six hours later, he was on a plane to New Jersey."We had him at hello," Thurman said.Reed met with Idzik before going to bed around 2:30 a.m., and then heading back to the facility after a few hours of sleep."We put him in some defenses just to see what he could remember with his partner (Dawan) Landry out there," Ryan said. "It was like, 'Whoa, here we go.'"It was like he hadn't missed a beat."___AP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken in Houston contributed to this report.___AP NFL website: pro32.ap

<p>HOUSTON Houston coach Gary Kubiak is back after recovering from a mini-stroke, and can t wait to coach his team Sunday against Oakland.   It just feels great to be back, he said. You have a true appreciation for the opportunity that you have and the opportunity to be around the players ... and the chance to do my job again.  Kubiak, who returned to work Monday, spoke to reporters Wednesday for the first time since collapsing on the field at halftime in Houston s loss to Indianapolis on Nov. 3.  He said doctors have limited his work this week, but that he will lead the team when the Texans try to break a franchise-record seven-game losing streak when they play the Raiders.   I m on kind of a different schedule kind of hard to adjust to, but I m adjusting to it, he said. I m listening to them.  The workaholic coach said he has learned through this ordeal he must take the advice of others and slow down some.   I ve obviously got a lot of people telling me what I need to do, he said.

<p> Green Bay will play Minnesota next weekend. It's not clear whether Rodgers will be ready to go or Mike McCarthy will have to go again with rookie Scott Tolzien, who was 24 of 34 for 339 yards and three interceptions in his first start.

<p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stevie Johnson has been ruled out for Sunday's game against the New York Jets because of a groin injury. That means the Bills will play without their top two receivers against the Jets. Rookie Robert Woods (ankle) was ruled out this week by coach Doug Marrone. The injuries are the latest blow to an already struggling passing attack. The Bills were unable to generate much through the air in the first meeting between the two teams, which New York won 27-20. Buffalo is 29th in the NFL in passing. Johnson leads the Bills in receiving with 41 receptions for 471 yards and three touchdowns. The six-year player is the only established veteran at wide receiver on Buffalo's roster.

<p>In need of income to satisfy creditors and baby mamasnot to mention the Dolphins, who were seeking to recoup portions of the signing bonus Williams had receivedthe gifted runner returned to the NFL in 2005. He didnt spend much time worrying about whether he would be accepted or if he still had the skill to be one of the games top players. But the return was not as seamless or comfortable as he anticipated.
</p>
<p>   Man, what an afternoon for the fans at Soldier Field. Not only did their game get delayed due to inclement weather for almost two hours, but the the Ravens and Bears took it to overtime! At least the Bears came out on top, and they now sit atop the NFC North thanks to losses by the Lions and Packers. So perhaps it wasn't a bad Sunday for Chicagoans after all.
