                                    Imagine gliding through the sprawling rainforest hanging by nothing but a zip-line, or walking on one of the dangling bridges internalizing the serene beauty with each step. The exploration is exhilarating, but exhausting too. You could lose track of time while playing with the waves in the shallow, clear-water sea basin or lazing on soft white sand, until the sun goes down and it's time to return to your vacation abode. A luxurious and cushy dwelling is just what you need to enjoy your South America vacations without stressing out.
