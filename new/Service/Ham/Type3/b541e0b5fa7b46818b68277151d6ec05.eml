Dear Ms. Samson,

Thank you for your inquiry.

apt (http://www.athens-holiday-rentals.com/index.files/Page917.htm) that is 
only available between Sep 5 to 12.

It is centrally located in a quiet residential neighborhood in the center of

idth=640&Height=480&all=true).
Else, it is only 50m and 150m from the nearest bus and metro and tram stops,

respectively, "Sygrou-Fix" stop, red line
(http://www.amel.gr/index.php?id=77&L=1). It is also equipped with broadband
internet.

Its daily rate
