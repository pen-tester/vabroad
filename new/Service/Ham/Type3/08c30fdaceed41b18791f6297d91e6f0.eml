Grant, your listing is #1 here
mamanuca beach house
On Google.com
We also have on google.com
#9 fiji vacation resorts
#7 fiji holiday rentals
But at that price; I cannot wait til you get a 7 night booking. You either
have to take it or not. My prices will not remain at this level... This is a
one time offer.
Linda

The best I can offer is 1 year for 50usd. And next year I am raising my
rates. Very few other websites have such a low rate.

Hi Linda,
Thanks for your email.
Would like to take it up, but things are a bit tight.
Could you look at a free listing for say 12 months and if I get a booking of
at least 7 nights I will renew for the 2 years.
Look forward to your understanding on this.
Kind regards,
Grant.
