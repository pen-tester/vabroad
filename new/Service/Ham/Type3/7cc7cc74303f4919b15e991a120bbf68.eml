Hi Fred,
The price will depend on the quality of the apartment, location and city.
You can always check and compare similar apartments.
Get a signed agreement. Do research on the owner through Google.com
See if there are any reviews about the apartment or comments about them on
other sites.
Ask the owner of the site; where you find the property if they know anything
about the owner or how long the owner has been on their site and if they
have had complaints. 
Do not give full payment before you see the property.
