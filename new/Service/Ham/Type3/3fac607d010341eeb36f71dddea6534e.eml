It is hard when someone wants to rent long term in the high season. Very few
owners will give a low price when they can get more money for the short term
rentals.

Linda - forgot to answer you back. They got a $3500 bid from some others in
downtown WP - Suzie was nice and wrote me many times. 

Moore's cabin would be more for almost 2 mths. Plus downtown is on the free
shuttle to the ski area. The owner for Sunnyside said she checked her
calendar and made $6200 during those dates last year, so she couldn't even
come close to their other bid of $3500. 

Oh well, try again. If I don't get a bunch of inquries for Sunnyside this
winter, maybe I'll switch it out with 'The Haven' - that is beautiful and on
the free shuttle.

Thx, Sue
