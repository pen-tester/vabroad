Unfortunately, we're having some issues with property management right now
and will not be renting until next summer.  I'm sorry I forgot to suspend
the advert.  There is a hotel nearby that's very nice and there are also
several pensions and hotels in the town of Assos.  If you would like their
names, please let me know.

Thanks for your interest

Patti
