Hello,

I wanted to contact you about a reciprocal link partnership. Our website
focuses on vacation home community reviews, area attractions, travel news
and generally promoting vacation rentals. We try very hard to write new
content on a regular basis. Our rankings and readership have been steadily
increasing. If you are interested, please let me knoe. I enjoying following
your site as well. Best of luck to you.

Sincerely,

Susan White
