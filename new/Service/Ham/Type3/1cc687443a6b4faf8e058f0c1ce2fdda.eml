I am adding links through twitter and facebook for the individual properties
when the client activates their listing. These are not links for the city
pages but rather is promoting the individual properties. 
Does google pick these up? 
Are there other sites where I can do something similar? 
I have a blog; but I don't want everything to be the same; facebook, blog
and twitter so I am going to blog about something else.
