Minor question; was it Kurt or Kevin Bohn you were going to deal with?
Kevin has started calling me because I said to "be aware when dealing with
the Bohn family"
Kevin said someone backed out of a contract with him; wondering if it was
you.

Yes he still owes me money. If you can get him to pay; it would be very
helpful.

I was curious does Mr. Bohn still owe you the commission as of today. As you
see I was going to be dealing with him on a project and am now a little
skeptical. Also I hate seeing people getting ripped off and I might be able
to get him to pay.Please let me know if he has paid you or not, thanks,
Mark.
