I have a client coconutgrove@connect.com.fj
And they tried to get their password reset so that they could use our site.
However, when the password was sent to them, it was bounced back with an
error. I am attaching that error.
My site only sends email to our customers and I was wondering how to get our
site removed from your banned list?
