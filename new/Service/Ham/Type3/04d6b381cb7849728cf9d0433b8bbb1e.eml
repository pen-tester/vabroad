Dear Sibylle!<br /><br />Your property "Directly on the Rhine River, where=
 RHINE, MOSEL and LAHN flow together, embedded in forest and vineyards"=
 (1 Bedroom Waterfront Vacation Home in Koblenz Rheinland-Pfalz Germany)<br=
 />listed on Vacations-abroad.com has been inquired about by Sarah McQuistion=
 (sarah.mcquistion@ct.spx.com).<br />Inquiry data:<br />Arrival date: 30=
 August 2009 <br />Length of stay: 2-3<br />Number of adults: 2<br />Comments:=
 I am interested in renting a 1 br apartment.  I am not positive of the=
 dates yet.  It would be somewhere in the date range of August 30-Sept.=
 2 for 2-3 nights.  Could you please tell me what your all-inclusive rates=
 would be during this time?  Are you close to the city center of Koblenz=
 or the train station?  We are thinking of staying here and heading on some=
 day excursions to different places on the Rhine and Mosel River Valley.=
  Is this a good location to do something like this from?  We were not planning=
 on renting a car, just traveling by boat and train, is this possible?<br=
 />
