Hi Howard, I checked the email inquiry. It has a telephone and an email that
is not a yahoo or google email. 
It seems to be legitimate.
I will send you a link to propay.com which is our credit card company and
when you make a payment, I will send you the inquiry.

Is your 3 years for US$100 still available? You have emailed me to say that
I have an enquiry but I am puzzled because I am no longer showing up on your
site. Your email says that to obtain this enquiry I would have to activate
my account - can you explain how I could have got an enquiry? It took an age
to do my listing  last time so I want to make sure it is worth it.
