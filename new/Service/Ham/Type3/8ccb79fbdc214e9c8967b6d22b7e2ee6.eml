The person making the inquiry last week specified your brother Kurt Bohn.
The subject of his email stated Kurt Bohn; not Kevin Bohn or the Bohn
family. 
Everyone in Sooke knows each other and is familiar with the bohn family and
I doubt that they search on the internet regarding Kurt Bohn or anything
regarding the Bohn family.  Your family already has their personal ties in
the community with people whom they work. My posting will not affect them. 

My posting does not say anything about individuals in the Bohn family. 

You want to sue me when it would be much easier to just get your brother to
pay me my money.
It is not like I did a bad job or the services I rendered were of a bad
quality.

He made money from my services; $20,000 and did not pay the commission
 
And I am not asking for interest on top of the money owed to me. I am being
reasonable. 

Use your energy to get your brother to pay up. Do something constructive. It
is him you should be yelling at.

I am a small business and the $2000 meant a lot to me.
