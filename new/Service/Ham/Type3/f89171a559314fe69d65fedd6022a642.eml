I apologise for being a pest, and thanks for your prompt response. I have
received the payment credit. I admit that I get anxious when internet money
transfer is being conducted. I am afraid I could be sending it to Nigeria
!!! It appears that all the worlds money is stored there, by the number of
emails I have received. I almost got caught with one transaction via Ebay,
but suspected the fraud due to a spelling mistake and notified Ebay who
confirmed it was a hoax.
thanks again for your trouble,
Courtney.
