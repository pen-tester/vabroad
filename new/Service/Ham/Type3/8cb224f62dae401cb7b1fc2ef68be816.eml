Ok I won't delete it. It is just that I don't want people visiting the site
to be frustrated and we are offering a special of two years for 50 bucks.
Great pricing.

Hi Marie, 
You have a listing on our website and have never activated the listing.

You are getting inquiries through our website and I wanted to discuss with
you the possiblity of activating your listing...
Currently your listing does not display the telephone number and contact
information. And when you get an inquiry through our site, the information
you receive will not contain the contact details of the person making the
inquiry. 
Our annual fee is $50usd and I thought you might be interested in activating
so that you can get these details.
I am also sending you the information that was contained in the most recent
emails.
