I was curious does Mr. Bohn still owe you the commission as of today. As you
see I was going to be dealing with him on a project and am now a little
skeptical. Also I hate seeing people getting ripped off and I might be able
to get him to pay.Please let me know if he has paid you or not, thanks,
Mark.
