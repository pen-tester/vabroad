Like I said. We get tourists from the USA, UK and Canada. I sent my =
figures.
You already made an offer that I accepted. It was a good Offer.=20
Then after I accept your offer, you changed the offer and reduced it =
again.
I already struck one offer with you when now you are trying to negotiate
lower.=20

You have already said that you would do 2 objects for 2 years for $75 =
and I
agreed. Now you change your mind and say 2 objects for 3 years for $75 =
and I
must respond No. we already have reached an agreement for the 2 years =
for 2
properties for $75, which is about 53 Euros. Or 25 Euros for each year. =
I
cannot negotiate my price any lower.  If you do not want to make the
payment. Then I will delete the listings.

Hi dear Linda,


I checked your website.

Very small number of Spain offers, very very small offers in Mallorca. =
No
bookings from your website the last time at all.

Give us 3 years for 2 locations for 75 USD and we continue and hope for =
one
booking at least.

You are not Spain specialised and your holiday makers do not book Europe
very much, indeed Spain/Mallorca.

From Homelidays or HomeAway we receive 300 inquiries a year for each =
object
(!) for 200 Euros fee, about 40.000 Euro bookings (!). Yes, really.

But we could stay with you and help you to support your listings in =
Europe
if you want for a symbolic amount of 75 USD.

No I check the text and fotos of our ads, maybe there is something bad.


Best,


Don Guillermo
