Greg, I haven't had the time to set up any delicious accounts nor have I =
spoken to any of my clients regarding links from their home pages.
However, I have been posting to Blogger 2-3 times a week and also to =
twitter.=20
This week I started changing the pages every day.=20
Once I do that for about a month; then I am going to try twice a day.=20

Now that you suggested that to get move up higher in the search engines; =
VRBO states on their site that they update their site every hour. Do you =
think that is part of why they are so high in the search engines?
Can I just ftp each page or do I need to make minor modifications to let =
the search engines know it is a new page.

If I decide to add Project 3; how much time in advance is needed?
Linda
