My neighbor had another incident; the whole building was being shaken
several times last night; I walked outside to see what was causing it and I
hear cursing and it sounded like someone was being beaten up. 
I don't know what happened but I called the cops again. 
My neighbors are always in this drunken stupor and fighting.
I am going to report to the management company tomorrow.
