 Hello Aled,
 
Thanks for the follow up. The rate you are requesting is significantly
higher than other 1 bedroom condo's we are looking at. We are looking at
$550.00 for the 8 nights as our max, if you can negotiate that we'd be ready
to book via paypal. 
 
Kind regards,
 
Robert Burkovski

Robert,
 
The condo is currently available for those dates.
 
For an 8 night stay it will cost $700. I will also require a security
deposit of $300. Payment of the deposit guarantees the reservation. My
preferred method of payment is paypal but I can also accept bank transfer.
 
The 1 bed apartment is very spacious(86 sqm) with living/dining, kitchen,
master bedroom with ensuite. It comes with parking, internet Wi-Fi and
skycable.
 
Kind Regards,
 
Aled Morris.
