 it is quite lovely.  This is our first sister's getaway vacation and my=
 50th birthday celebration.  We will be arriving late into Trinidad 10:30pm=
 on January 5th, 2010.  We will not arrive to Tobago until the next day=
 when we can get a flight.  I must research this as I have never been to=
 Tobago/Trinidad.  My husband will be joining us on or around the 13th of=
 January but my sister will be leaving the next day.  I hope that our dates=
 are available.  =0D=0A=0D=0AIs the property isolated from restaurants,=
