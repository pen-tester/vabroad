Hi I`m Adam Davies from comparecarhire.co.uk. We are one of the leading car
hire comparators on the web searching over 40 car hire suppliers finding
consumers the best deal. .

I am looking for partners that compliment our site and vacations-abroad.com
seems a good fit. We can either:-

1) Exchange links with you

-	OR -

2) Our team have been working hard creating content on our own site and we
wondered if you would be interested in some free of charge content written
just for vacations-abroad.com.

Our editors cover a wide range of subjects and can quickly agree a subject
with you and write specifically for you - you will have full editorial
control and it definitely won`t be a sales pitch for us.

All we would ask is that you allow us to include one simple text link back
to comparecarhire.co.uk towards the end of the content which will hopefully
be found by the search engines in the longer term - which is how we would
benefit.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Kind Regards - Adam Davies
Webmaster, www.comparecarhire.co.uk
