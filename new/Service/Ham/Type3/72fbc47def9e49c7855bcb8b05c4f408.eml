calendar at

We have all had a fantastic last 2 weeks and are unfortunately leaving for
the airport in the next hour ! Have loved the view, morning & night.
Dolphins always seem to be right outside ! The pool & spa have been very
relaxing and we will miss sitting out and relaxing with such a wonderful
view. Thank you very much!
