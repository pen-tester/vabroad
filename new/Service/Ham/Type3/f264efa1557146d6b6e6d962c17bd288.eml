Sorry; vacations-abroad.com is not a commission based website. Good Luck. I
will remove you from our site.

Thank you for your email informing us about our renewal on your website. I
would really like to see Colona Castle listed with you, but unfortunately we
do not have a marketing budget for this. I have spoken to the owners about
your email, and we would like you to please consider the offer that we are
proposing. Would you list Colona Castle on a commission basis, we will be
glad to start with a 10% commission on all confirmed bookings that we
receive from your website. If we find that we are receiving regular bookings
from your website then we would be more than willing to increase the
commission.



We hope that you find our attempt to compensate for your services, a
suitable alternative.

I look forward to your earliest favorable reply.

Kind regards

Alisa Soderlund
