Linda ...
I have emailed you, and we have actually spoken ...
1.  Requested log-in information .... never received.
2. In a year we received 2 supposed inquireries, interestingly enough =
only recently as our subscription is about to expire.
3. Albeit $50.00 is not a lot for a site, however, 2 inquireries ... not =
that strong a site.
4.  To-date I still do not have log-in information so I have absolutely =
no idea as to accuracy, or availability calendar.
More times than not the site is impossible to pull up ... extremely slow =
loading.
Neither of your suggested requests can be accommodated.

Advising ... we won't be renew.
