 Hello Anna,

It is very odd that Hotmail thinks that your IP is a dynamic IP as it is not
dynamic, but rather static and only assigned to your server.

Your IP has a valid rDNS address of mail.vacations-abroad.com.  I have
updated your SmarterMail hostname to match this rDNS entry which will help
in sending mail.  I also noticed that your server did not require SMTP
authentication, meaning that your server could be used as an "open relay"
for spammers to send spam through.  Not requiring SMTP authentication means
that someone could send mail without providing a login and password.  I have
changed this so that SMTP authentication is not required.

I would recommend contacting Hotmail by filling out this form.

https://support.msn.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsmsbl&ct=eformts&scrx=1

Explain to them that the IP address 76.12.12.144 is not a dynamic IP, but a
static one assigned only to your server.  You may also want to note that
your IP has a valid rDNS entry and your domain vacations-abroad.com has a
valid SPF record.

If you have any further questions, please ask.

Regards,
