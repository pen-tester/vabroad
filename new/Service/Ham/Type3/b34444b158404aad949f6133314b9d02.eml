Subject: What are the policies for renting a hotel room

Hello,
What are the policies for renting a hotel room?
I need a little help/direction before I can start.  Any nuggets of wisdom
would be absolutely great and very much appreciated.  Please point me in the
right direction.
Thanks.  Sincerely, James
