Could you please do that or should I test the new system first.

 Linda,

No I did not.  I stopped the SmarterMail service but I did not remove
anything from the old VPS.

If you are no longer using SmarterMail on the old VPS at all feel free to
remove the c:\smartermail directory which contains your domains/email.

Let us know if we can be of any further assistance.

>Hi,
Did you delete the information regarding mail server off of my main VPS? 
I moved my mail server to the new vps to free up space and memory. Did you
insure that the migration deleted everything off my old server regarding
mail.

 Hello Linda,

I've just finished migrating mail from your .NET VPS to the new Windows Base
VPS.  At this time all mail for vacations-abroad.com should be delivered to
the new server.

- - - 

updated MX, SPF, rDNS

copied mail to new VPS

updated host name to vacations-abroad.com

confirmed grey listing is disabled

sent test messages TO/FROM Yaoo/Google and all worked

- - -

You can access SmarterMail on the new VPS @ http://76.12.12.144:9998 with
admin/admin as the login

Let us know if we can be of any further assistance.
