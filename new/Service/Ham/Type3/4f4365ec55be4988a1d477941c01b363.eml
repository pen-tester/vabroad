Lei,
I am not really set up to do all of that.=20
I do not do design for websites and my site takes all of my time.  I =
just do not have the time even if I used some of my own people.=20
But let me explain some of the aspects of managing a website.

If you are going to run a conceirge service; you will need to figure out =
how you will make money. Working on a commission is probably the easiest =
way if you know the local people and have dealt with them in the past.
If you do not have too many clients; then the site would only need a few =
pages; perhaps 10-15 page and you would not need a big database.=20
Then if you want to be at the top of the search engines; you would need =
to have someone build links for you.
Each aspect will cost money.
Design 1-2000
Website set up 1-3000
Link building 1-2000

I would love to do this for you; but I am so busy working on my site =
that I do not have the resources and time to do that. But I will =
recommend two companies here in the usa.
1- http://www.webfu-design.com/
2- http://www.intensetech.com/

If you do decide on either of those companies; let me know. (Maybe they =
will give me a discount of the services they provide me, Ha)
For them to give you an estimate; you need be specific on the number of =
pages you want on your site. And it sounds like you would want someone =
to do most of the work; except for the input.=20

I will send you the link for the payment from my credit card company; =
propay.com
Talk to you later.
Linda

Thanks Linda, send me my link so I can take a look at it and then view =
for any adjustments and then I will pay for 2 years.
=20
Do you do website designs/pages as I am thinking of setting up a =
Conceirge business in Nova Scotia and would like to get a website set up =
for this, really top of the line one.  What would your price range be?  =
I can most probably do all of the typing etc, I just need the fancy =
designs and presentations and then set up to links online so when anyone =
wants this service worldwide my site would be one of the first ones to =
come up.



Kind regards and enjoy today,
