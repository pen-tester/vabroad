Nice speaking with you.
I would like to offer you a special offer for your second property. 
I will give you advertising for 2 properties for 1 year for $50usd.
Your property 5069 is not active and you get inquiries that you do not get
on your other property. 

Property 5151 expires in October; I will extend it's expiration to October
2010 when you make the payment of $50usd. (about 35 Euros)
I am sending an email from my credit card company, www.propay.com , where
you can make a payment through a secure method. 

You can modify property 5069 to reflect any property. Just login to your
account and make the changes. 

Let me know if you have questions.
