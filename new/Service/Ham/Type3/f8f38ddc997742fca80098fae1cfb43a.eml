Dear Sir

I paid a membership to have my property listed with you and I see that it
has not been listed on your website.

Please urgently explain youselves as I have paid for a service and you have
not provided anything.

You toom USD 50 on 15th July from my credit card for a special offer listing
of 2 years.

How comes my listing is and HAS NOT been displayed on your website?

An urgent response will be appreciated before I contact my credit card
company to request my monies back.
