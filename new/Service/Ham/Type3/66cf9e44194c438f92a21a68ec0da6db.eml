Above are some of the key words for your listing on our site.

Our annual fee is $50usd. I was wondering if you might consider activating
your listing on our site; as you have been receiving inquiries. However, the
inquiries you have received do not list the contact information of the
person making the inquiry, since you have not activated your listing. Let me
know if you are interested as high season is coming up.
