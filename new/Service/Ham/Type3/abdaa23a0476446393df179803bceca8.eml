Brian, there were supposed to be diamond earrings that I was to receive. I
have not received those. 
Also, you told me that I did not have to sign the release ; however, the
document states that I cannot cash the check unless I sign the release. I
have no documents that state anything about the income or expenses
associated with the final accounting of the estate but yet I am required to
sign a release. I find this a bit unsettling that I am signing a release
when I have no documents regarding the release. And you did not bother to
discuss this with me and sent me a bill for $225 when all you did was open
the envelope.

Brian,
Just wanted to follow up. I never heard back from you nor have I received
the check you mentioned you had received from the Estate of Babara L.
Jenkins
 
It has been over 10 days and I would think the check should have arrived by
now. Let me know what is going on.

Brian, Shouldn't I have some documents to review before I sign any release
of liability? I do not see how I can sign a release of liabiity since I have
no idea of any of the transactions that have occurred through the estate.

Hi Brian, Please send the check and documents to my attention and I will
then pay the invoice when it is issued. 
Thank you for your help.

Linda:

 

Earlier this afternoon, I received two items from the attorney representing
Minnie Key, the Executrix of your mother's Estate.  First, Ms. Key has made
full and final distribution of the funds of the Estate.  As you will recall,
a reserve amount of cash was retained by Ms. Key to be certain that all
final claims and expenses of administration could be adequately covered.
These final expenses have been paid, and the result is a final distribution
to you in the amount of $8,766.25.  My office is in possession of a
cashier's check payable to you in the same amount.

 

Second, Ms. Key's attorney enclosed a Receipt and Release and requested that
you sign the document and return it to his office.  The Receipt and Release
is typically requested of each beneficiary of an Estate and will be filed
with the Court upon your return of the document.  It acknowledges that you
have received the share of the Estate to which you are entitled, and
acknowledges that you release the Executrix from liability related to her
administration.  Based upon my review of the administration, I see no reason
why you should not sign and return the Receipt and Release, and I will
forward it to you shortly.

 

Finally, my office uses a couple of different procedures to see that the
beneficiaries receive their final distribution, and I will employ either of
them at your option.  First, my firm can deposit the $8,766.25 cashier's
check into our client trust account and forward you our firm's check for the
balance after all final charges to your account are deducted.  In your case,
with my receipt and review of the documents today, the final outstanding
charges to your account total $200.00.  At your option, I will forward you
the remaining balance together with the Receipt and Release.  Mr. Sutherland
has included a return envelope which you may then use to return the signed
Receipt and Release to his office.

 

Or, you may wait until the final invoices for the month of July are prepared
and yours is sent to you.  Upon receipt of your final payment for your final
invoice, which again will reflect all charges through the end of July
($200.00), I will gladly send you the original cashier's check, the Receipt
and Release and the return envelope to send the signed document to Mr.
Sutherland's office.

 

Please advise me as to which of these two methods you wish to employ to
receive your final distribution from your mother's Estate.



Yours very truly,

Ford & Mathiason LLP
