Hi,
I ordered myself one also. It is very small. 
These are pictures of the plant.

They say that the seed heads of the flowers can create lots of seedlings in
some environments and it needs a heavy pruning either in the fall after
blooming, to prevent reseeding or in the spring.

Linda, we received the plant late on Friday (11th) which was sent from
Torrington, CT.
It arrived in a sealed box and had brown tops on the two small limbs.  I
place it in 
water at once and I think it will survive.  Sunday I added a little plant
fertilizer in the water 
and I think it improved some.  It is called "Clematis paniculata".  We have
picked a wall 
space to plant it after the next five days expected rains.
We thank you very much for your thoughtfulness.
Love from both of us.   M & R
