Dear Maria!<br /><br />Your property "Escape to this tropical paradise and=
 make the pressures of the world disappear" (1 Bedroom Cottage in Sabadeco=
 Bonaire Netherlands Caribbean)<br />listed on Vacations-abroad.com has=
 been inquired about by Bruce McGinnis (dkmcginnis@yahoo.com, contact telephone:=
 (303) 757-3715).<br />Inquiry data:<br />Arrival date: 28 March 2009 <br=
 />Length of stay: 6<br />Number of adults: 2<br />Number of children: 1<br=
 />Comments: We are interested in your Sabadeco cottage for a week the end=
 of March.  My wife and I would be bringing our 17 yr old daugter with the=
 hopes of teaching her to scuba dive.  Are there any local dive operations=
 near the cottage that would be  suiitable for a beginner?  Would we be=
 able to use your vehicle for transport or do we need a rental car?  We=
 have never been to Bonaire- is the cottage location suitable for some easy=
 shore diving for myself and my wife? Thanks so much for your help.  Bruce<br=
 />
