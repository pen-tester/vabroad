There will be a link to your site. Emails will come through our site but go
to you direct. You will receive an email that gives you the person's name,
telephone number and their email address.
Inquiries stored means that when you login to your account, you can see the
inquiries that you have received.  
Are you interested in our three years for 100usd?
