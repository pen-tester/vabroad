Hi Linda,
It is such a shame you don't have faith in your own web site.
I have over one million dollars invested in my house in Fiji and you still
want me to take all the risk !!! Lets work together?
Cheers
Grant.

Grant, your listing is #1 here
mamanuca beach house
On Google.com
We also have on google.com
#9 fiji vacation resorts
#7 fiji holiday rentals
But at that price; I cannot wait til you get a 7 night booking. You either
have to take it or not. My prices will not remain at this level... This is a
one time offer.
Linda

The best I can offer is 1 year for 50usd. And next year I am raising my
rates. Very few other websites have such a low rate.

Hi Linda,
Thanks for your email.
Would like to take it up, but things are a bit tight.
Could you look at a free listing for say 12 months and if I get a booking of
at least 7 nights I will renew for the 2 years.
Look forward to your understanding on this.
Kind regards,
Grant.
