Yes business is bad everywhere.
But in the USA the stock market has been going up since March and this =

France  and Germany are already out of the recession.
So people will start spending on travel soon.

Hi Linda,

I will try to find 2 listing for you. Right now business has been poor =
but its starting to look better for next year.

If it continues, we will consider running a one year ad.

All the best,

Michael Thomas
