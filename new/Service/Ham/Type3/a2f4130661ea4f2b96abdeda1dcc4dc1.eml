Subject: Chalet du Geant, Tremblant



Hello Jason,

 

Thank you for inquiring about our "Chalet du Geant", the highest-rated
rental chalet on the Mont-Tremblant resort. Just this month, the Ministry of
Tourism inspector for the Province of Quebec awarded us a 5-Star tourism
residence rating, and commented that we surpassed the 5-Star requirements.
My wife Liz and I take great pride in providing our guests with the finest
accommodations possible, and our chalet is loaded with the finest amenities,
including luxury linens and towels, heated bathroom floors, a gourmet
kitchen, dining room that seats over 16 people, games room with billiards
table, media room with HD TV and surround sound, infrared sauna, 7 person
spa, etc. All our bedrooms are "above-grade" with large windows, not in a
dark basement like most of the other chalets.

 

Our chalet features 6 bedrooms, 4 of which are King beds, and the other 2
are Queen beds. 3 of the 4 King bedrooms have private full ensuite baths,
and the 4th is on the top level and shares the main full bath with a Queen
bedroom, accessed from the upper hallway, and only 3 steps from either
bedroom door. If you take a look at our website, you will see the floor plan
for each level.

 

We are the closest chalet subdivision to the pedestrian village. There are
no chalets closer, only condo buildings and hotels. We have a free resort
shuttle, which stops right at our front door every 30 minutes (on call
during off-season), taking you right to the pedestrian village and the
gondola. It is so convenient. We are about a 10 minute walk downhill to the
pedestrian village, but coming back is uphill, of course (take the
shuttle!).

 

Unfortunately, we cannot accept any pets. Not because we don't believe you
about the behavior, but because we have guests that are extremely allergic
to pet dander, and they want us to certify that our chalet has never had any
guests with pets. Our weekend rate for 3 nights at that time is $2,750 CAD
plus tax. For 2 nights on the weekend would be $1,950 CAD plus tax. We
accept Visa, MasterCard and Amex, and require 50% with the reservation, and
the balance is due 45 days before arrival. We send you a Rental Agreement
via email for your signature, confirming that the chalet is reserved for
you.

 

In the meantime, please visit our own website at  <http://www.GoSkiGolf.com>

Thanks for inquiring, and I hope to hear from you soon.
