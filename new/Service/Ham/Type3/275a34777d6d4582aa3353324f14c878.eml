 Why am I getting this error. This is a legitimate website and I am getting
the error that no MX records are found.

Hi Bobbi,
The strangest thing; I was thinking about you the last two days; then got
your email. Decided to give you a call and when I telephoned your message
said you were traveling. I found the name of your daughter's hotel next to
your name and called the hotel to see if you were staying there. They said
you were due there that evening or tomorrow..
Just a series of strange coincidences. 
Hope your doing fine; and escaped from the heat of the desert.  I may call
in a couple of days just to chat and say HI. Take care.
