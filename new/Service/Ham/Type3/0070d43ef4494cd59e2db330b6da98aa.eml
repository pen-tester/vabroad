Hmm; what are you doing when you are trying to update?

Dear Ms. Jenkins,

Please view the request below. We do not rent our villa for less than a
week.

I am almost certain that this request is a scam: "Mr. Smith" is asking to
pay via check, has a yahoo address and does not speak proper English - these
are all criteria mentioned in scam warnings for home owners.

Also,I have been trying to update my listing. This does not work, I keep
receiving "error" messages.
Could you kindly look into this?
Thank you.

Regards,
Elisabeth
