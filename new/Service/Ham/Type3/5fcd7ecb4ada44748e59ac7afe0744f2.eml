Hi Robert,

You received an inquiry yesterday. These are some of the other inquiries =
you received. I noticed you are an agent. I can even give you a better =
rate if you list 2 properties.
I think I offered you two years for $50usd. I will let you have two =
properties for 2 years for $50usd.
Good Deal?
Linda Jenkins
