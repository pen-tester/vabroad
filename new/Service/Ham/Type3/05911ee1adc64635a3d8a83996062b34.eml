Subject: Correction:Community Mushroom Walk and Presentation Saturday!






 Sorry!  The date of the walk is Saturday, August 22, 2009 at 9:00 am.
 

What: Mushroom Walk and Presentation 


When: Saturday, August 22, 2009 at 9:00 am 


Where: Red Top Mountain State Park 


Address: 50 Lodge Rd SE, Cartersville, GA 30121 


Leader:  Mary Woehrel 


Comments: We will meet at the Lodge on Lodge Road at 9:00 am and then go to
the Iron Hil trail for a walk, collecting mushrooms and bringing them back
to the Lodge's Lakeside Conference Room for discussion and ID.  Mary Woehrel
will do a presentation about 11:00 am on how to identify mushrooms.  We
should finish up about 11:30 or 11:45.  The walk and presentation are open
to the public.  Bring your lunch to share at a picnic table afterward. 



Please do not hunt mushroom for two weeks before a walk.  It is only through
your cooperation that we can have successful walks.  Please do not begin
hunting mushrooms before the leader starts the walk so that everyone has a
fair chance of discovery. All walks will be held rain or shine.  Come 15-30
minutes early and socialize.  All walks start on time, so be early.  If you
are late, we will already be in the woods. For all walks, bring water,
basket, paper, cloth or wax paper bags to keep mushrooms separated, (plastic
bags melt mushrooms) whistle, hand lens, insect repellent, cell phone and
books for identification.  Also bring a knife to dig up mushrooms for
identification or to cut edibles off cleanly.  Try to dig up three of the
same species at different stages of development.  Don't pick old mushrooms;
leave them to drop their spores.  Don't take the identification of the
person standing next to you.  They might not know as much as you do.  Do
your own spore print or ID work and make your own decisions.  Whether you
decide to eat a mushroom is ultimately only your decision.  Take notes and
pictures to help you remember habitat.  If you choose to leave to go home or
search away from the group, be sure to let the walk leader know so we don't
worry about your being lost.
