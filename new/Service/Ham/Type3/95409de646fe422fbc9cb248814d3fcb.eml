Dear Sergio,
 
Many thanks for enquiring about our lovely Villa 6!
 
Unfortunately I have just accepteda booking for the period of time you have
asked for, and so now the villa is no longer free in August.
 
I do however have other properties that I could offer, but they will not be
at the same rate, they will be at a rate of approximately 100 GBP per
night....would this suit your budget?

With warm regards
 
Lorraine
