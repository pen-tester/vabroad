Larry, I can add your listing to our website and get a couple of key words
for your property pertaining to St Thomas.
We are offering a special of 3 years for $100usd.  
I would take most of the information from your website.
All listings include 7 photos, a link to your website and all inquiries are
stored in your account. 
Each listing has a page view counter at the bottom of the page.

Are you interested?
Linda Jenkins
