 Hello Linda,

Thank you for verifying the information.  I corrected the reverse DNS for
76.12.12.144 so that it returns the mail server 'mail.vacations-abroad.com'
in a lookup.  Please let us know if there are still any issues.

Thank you.

Website www.vacations-abroad.com
My main domain is 76.12.121.214
My email domain is 76.12.12.144
I set up a separate ip for my mail because my email was using a lot of
memory when I sent out emails to my clients... Trying to get them to make a
payment on their account.

 Hello Linda,

The issue is that the source IP 76.12.12.144 reverses to
vacations-abroad.com, however vacations-abroad.com points to 76.12.121.214.
This creates a Reverse DNS failure because the domain isn't pointing back to
the same IP.

We'll need to have a reverse record for 76.12.12.144 point to a domain that
points back to that IP. What domains do you have pointing to 76.12.12.144?
Also, please verify the account administrator login and password for the
Hostmysite control panel or the last 4 digits of the credit card on file to
approve the Reverse DNS change.
Thank you for using Hostmysite.com.
