Linda - you can send the details on - honestly, just spoke with the =
owner and she said she gets 'these' all the time. Ski instructors, etc =
want a place for cheap  - she's figuring out a cost now. This owner said =
she pays $1,000 HOA's every month - so it may not be that cheap.=20

Thx for sending details - Sue

she's not.

So here I sit wishing I was on the beach. Let me know the above....Sue
