See the museums; Lourve etc. They have such excellent collection of famous
artists; sculptures, paintings.
Visit the Left Bank. Enjoy the restaurants along the left bank.
Versailles is not very far away from Paris so you can take a side trip. 

But when you are in Paris. Be careful, with your belongings and money. There
are pickpockets and they prey on tourists.
