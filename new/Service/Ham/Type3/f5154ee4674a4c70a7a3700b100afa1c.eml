This is a link to a company in LA. I knew them when I was in San Francisco
and they have done government work. Not airport work but government
contracts. I was more friends with his wife and mother in law; but they are
nice people.

Just in case you might need a small company for this type of work. 


Also, I spoke with the lady at Ethan Allen. She says the credit card she has
on file is the one ending in 0709. so you need to speak to her. She will
call this afternoon on your cell phone.
