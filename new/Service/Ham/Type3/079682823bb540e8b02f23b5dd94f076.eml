RE:   KURT BOHN JR. - WEIRS BEACH LODGE - LIABLE INTERNET POST MADE BY YOU



Hello Linda,


My name is Kevin Bohn, I am Kurt Bohn's brother 'his family'.  I am writing
in regards the above noted internet post.

The claims that you have made in regards to anyone 'OTHER' than Kurt Bohn on
that post are unfactual and based on speculation...

If you do not remove anything that is not directly related to your personal
association with Kurt Bohn at Weirs Beach and follow up with a retraction of
the same, I will commence an action against you and your company for
defamation of charater both personally and my business.

Please confirm with me once you have done so by on or before September 1st,
2009.

Please note: attached is a direct copy off the internet of the liable
post...

Thank you,

  
Kevin Bohn

The Grouse Nest Resort


Grouse Nest Resort in Sooke Vancouver Island BC
Kurt Bohn Jr. and The Grouse Nest Resort
Sooke, Vancouver Island British Columbia Canada
http://www.grousenestresort.com



In 2004 I was contacted by Kurt Bohn Jr. who wanted to advertise "The Lodge
At Weirs Beach" through my website. He signed an agreement to work on a
commission basis with my company. A few months later, I booked some clients
into his property to run a workshop for one month. Kurt cleared about
$20,000 CAD and was supposed to pay me a 15% commission. In fact he offered
a higher commissioin percentage than I had requested. He never paid me my
commission and the folks who rented the property said that although they had
paid in full, they would never go through a private rental again because
Kurt was so difficult to deal with. He was never around and did not return
phone calls. Kurt continually lied to me about sending my payment, which he
never did. I spoke with other people in the Sooke area and he has a bad
reputation but somehow, in 2005, he was able to finance "The Grouse Nest
Resort" which is a huge resort in Sooke BC. And he still would not pay my
commission and he made $20,000 through my site. He is a crook who lies and
steals. Beware, Be very aware when you deal with him and his family. I have
also filed complaints with collection agencies in Canada regarding the debt.

This week, the week of February 3rd, 2008, Kurt Bohn Jr. has called me three
times. The first time he called, he said that he wanted to clear this up and
make the payment but that he had to transfer the money to his checking
account. He speaks in this sweet little boy's voice, trying to sound so
sweet and inocent, like he would never do anything wrong. Then later this
week Kurt called again stating that I had to sign a document before he would
send the payment. Kurt also has asked me to reduce the amount he owes me by
over 20% but he wanted to pay by credit card and also I had to sign a
document. He said that he was only trying to resolve the situation. I agreed
to the reduction in the amount he owes me, but I would not accept a credit
card from him because he can always have the bank cancel the charge, nor
would I sign anything that he would ask for me to sign. I told him I wanted
a cashiers check in USD and I would not accept a credit card as payment.
However, once I received cash in hand I would make efforts to remove any
comments about him I had posted on the internet. So today, February 09,
2008, he called again. Kurt's tone had totally changed and he said he is not
paying. Saying I had done something wrong. Of which I had not done anything
during the time we had last spoken. Probably the only reason he called this
week was because he wanted me to sign the document he submitted. I think he
was going to try and trick me in some way shape or form. 

This is probably the 12-15th or is it the 20th time he has said he would pay
me and he never does. That is why I will not sign anything that is initiated
by him. Originally when I was dealing with him, I agreed to alot of stuff,
but now everytime he says he will pay I say I will believe it when I see it.
Don't waste your time with Kurt or the Grouse Nest Resort
