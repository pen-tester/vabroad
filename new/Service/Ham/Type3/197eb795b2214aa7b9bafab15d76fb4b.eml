I found this on the internet regarding dynamic IP.

550 DY-001 Mail rejected by Windows Live Hotmail for policy reasons. We
generally do not accept email from dynamic IP's as they are not typically
used to deliver unauthenticated SMTP e-mail to an Internet mail server. If
you are not an e-mail/network admin please contact your E-mail/Internet
Service Provider for help. http://www.spamhaus.org maintains lists of
dynamic and residential IP addresses.
