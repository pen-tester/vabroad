The Imbat Hotel is about 1 km from the property.  It's on the water, very
beautiful, quiet, and has great food.  Their number is 286-737-0101.  I'm
not sure if they speak English, but if you need help making a reservation,
we can call for you.

In Assos (modern day Behramkale) is the Kervansaray Hotel (286-721-7093 or
721-7198) and the Grand Assos Hotel (286-721-7273 or 721-7006).  There is
also a pension called the Biber Evi, which is furnished Ottoman style.
Their number is 286-721-7410.  

I hope this helps.

I'm sorry, but the property is not available during that time.  There is a
hotel just up the road that is quite nice and several pensions in the
village of Assos.  If you would like names and numbers of a few, let me
know.

Thank you for your interest.
