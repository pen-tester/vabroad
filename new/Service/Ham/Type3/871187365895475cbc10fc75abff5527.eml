Subject: RE: Your January vacation at Palm Tree Villas


Dear Elsie,

Thank you for your interest in Palm Tree Villas, a beach-side resort =
recommended by the Life magazine and top-rated on www.tripadvisor.com. =
We offer 'home away from home' style accommodations with full kitchens, =
private patios and separate bedrooms with pillow-top mattresses on king =
size beds. All our units are at ground level and situated around our =
heated pool with spa jets and a large sun deck. The sugar white beach =
and the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico are a mere 3 minutes stroll =
away.

I am happy to be able to offer you a two bedroom-one bath villa for your =
dates in January. The rate is $1,115 per week for up to four persons.  =
The total cost of your ten nights vacation, including the 11.5% tax, =
will be $1,772.85.

We have recently completed a total renovation of all our two bedroom =
villas which now sport new kitchens and baths with granite countertops =
and large French doors opening out to garden patios.  Please take a =
virtual tour from our home page at www.palmtreevillas.com to view our =
new two bedroom villas.

Please note that we do not charge any cleaning fee and offer free use of =
our new laundry facility, free Wi-Fi and free local phone calls.  We =
also provide beach chairs and a beach umbrella.  Of course, our most =
appreciated amenity is our king size beds with a pillow-top mattress - =
you will not sleep better anywhere else on this island!  Please let me =
know if you would like to confirm this reservation. I will need a =
deposit of $700 and we accept all major credit cards.

Please visit our web site at www.palmtreevillas.com where you will find =
an aerial photo showing how close we are to the beach, as well as guest =
comments, room layouts and a list of amenities. You may also want to =
visit =

Getaway_at_Palm_Tree_Villas-Anna_Maria_Florida.html to view independent =
reviews posted by some of our guests.  Please let me know if you need =
any additional information.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

Peggy
