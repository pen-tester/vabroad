Been thinking about getting PR4 and how difficult it is.
Well, my front page is a PR 4; and the links from the front page moved the
other pages upwards.

Before I was using you; I worked with a guy who created my link directory. 
http://resources.vacations-abroad.com

He utilized two methods. 
1-it was a link farm.
2-he also sent emails to people outside the link farm.
My PR went from 3 to 4 on my main page.

Well, What if when I talk with my customers; I suggest they put an image
with a link to my main site. Some of them have a PR 4 or PR 3 for their main
page.
This high ranking page will then point back to my main page ; which then
will be pointing to internal pages on my site. And bring the internal pages
higher in google.  

But what about the link farm directory. It could provide links to the main
page and you can work on the city page links. 
I get inquiries all the time from people who want to trade links.
But I am not sure what happens when using a link farm; I have heard it can
be bad.
So I am asking you ; what do you think.
