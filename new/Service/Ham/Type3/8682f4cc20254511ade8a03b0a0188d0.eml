Yes I am looking into it. I cannot find your payment in Paypal but I do find
your payment in Propay
The email that you sent me was only a money request. I am still researching
but I do not see duplicate payment
The Paypal is only a money request not a payment.

Hi Linda,
Once again I find my emails either not received by you, or not replied.I
have written to explain that We Have paid twice for our one year
subscription for our site 6278 at Silay PH. One payment thro Paypal and trhe
other thro Propay. We have also noticed that our entry on Vacations Abroad
has been dimmed.
Would you please check and return our second payment.
thanks again,
Courtney Parkin
