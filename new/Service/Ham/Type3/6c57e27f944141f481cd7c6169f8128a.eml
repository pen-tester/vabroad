It has come to my notice that we have paid twice for the one year
subscription to you for our site 6278 at Silay,PH.. One payment was thro
Paypal and the other thro Propay.
We have also noticed that our site on Vacations Abroad is dimmed. Would you
please check and refund the second payment.
Thanks
Courtney Parkin
