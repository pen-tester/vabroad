01/11/2009 - 30/11//2009
However,a Certified Bank cashier check of  $9,500  will be sent to
you,that will cover your rental services and you should keep the
remaining money which will be used by the couple for their daily
welfare on their arrival.

from 01/11/2009 - 30/11//2009
(2) YOUR FULL NAME (name on cheque of Euro 9,500 )

(4) PHONE NUMBERS.
for payment to be delivered to you.
Please remember that this business requires prompt response.
