Bryan,
I had a new vps set up today to handle all my email function and
discontinued the email server through the old ip address 76-12.121.214 
The email is supposed to be going through my new mail server.

 Hello Linda,

Your mail form was not working because there was no domain set up in
SmarterMail to handle the email.  SmarterMail requires that there be a
domain configured to allow message relay.

I configured the domain localdomain.local and set it to use the IP address
76.12.121.214, which is the IP address specified in your web.config.  The
form now completes and displays a confirmation message that the email was
sent.

For your reference, here is som additional information for the domain I
created:

The domain admin is:
Username: localadmin@localdomain.local
Password: Fp59GmW284

SMTP Auth is required but bypassed for local IP addresses.
This means that all email from your server will be relayed but SMTP
connections from any other source mush authenticate as a user to send email.
This prevents your server from being used as an open relay by spammers.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to
contact us.

Regards,
