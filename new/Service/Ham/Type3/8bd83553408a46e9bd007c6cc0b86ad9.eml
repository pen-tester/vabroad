Dear Mrs Jenkis,

I contact you because we want to cancel our collaboration with
Vacations-Abroad.com because  half property will be sold and half will =
be
used as private home.

We want to thank you for the great cooperation had until today.


Thank you so much for everything!
Warmest regards
Aristide Fiorentino.
