Hi,
The first listing
http://www.vacations-abroad.com/canada/quebec/mt_tremblant/173/default.as=
px
This used to be my neighbor. Geraldine Wilson, she and her husband rent =
chalets and small cottages on the North part of Tremblant. On the north =
side it is more Quebecois and not as touristy as the village. There are =
a couple of good restaurants but you will see more nature.  However, the =
ski slopes are only a 5 minute drive and on these slopes you can ski =
into the the center of the big new village.=20
Geraldine's rentals are located on one of the larger lakes in the =
region. She and her husband have lived in the area for ages and know =
everyone and so if one of her apartments is too small ; she can probably =
rent you a smaller chalet.

This company
http://www.vacations-abroad.com/canada/quebec/mt_tremblant/6320/default.a=
spx
has a series of luxury condos and chalets in the newer village.  They =
are bigger and more expensive. They have been on my site for several =
years.=20

This is another real estate agent that focuses on Tremblant Rentals
http://www.vacations-abroad.com/canada/quebec/mt_tremblant/3793/default.a=
spx

For all the listings
http://www.vacations-abroad.com/canada/quebec/mt_tremblant/default.aspx

Let me know if you have any questions?
