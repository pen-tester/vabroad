Thanks Aled for the reply. Yes, I understand the exclusive nature of your
building and if we had a higher budget we would definitely opt for yours
over the others, unfortunately we'll have to pass at that rate.
 
All the best,
 
Robert

Robert,
 
Thanks for getting back to me.
 
I can only go as low as $80/night which works out as $640. I'm sure there
are cheaper condos out there but Serendra is in such demand I can command a
premium. I've been 95% occupied for the past 9 months so my rates work for
me. Also, bear in mind the apartment is 86 sqm - extremely spacious for a
one bed in the city centre.

All the best.
 
Aled.

 Hello Aled,
 
Thanks for the follow up. The rate you are requesting is significantly
higher than other 1 bedroom condo's we are looking at. We are looking at
$550.00 for the 8 nights as our max, if you can negotiate that we'd be ready
to book via paypal. 
 
Kind regards,
 
Robert Burkovski

Robert,
 
The condo is currently available for those dates.
 
For an 8 night stay it will cost $700. I will also require a security
deposit of $300. Payment of the deposit guarantees the reservation. My
preferred method of payment is paypal but I can also accept bank transfer.
 
The 1 bed apartment is very spacious(86 sqm) with living/dining, kitchen,
master bedroom with ensuite. It comes with parking, internet Wi-Fi and
skycable.
 
Kind Regards,
 
Aled Morris.
