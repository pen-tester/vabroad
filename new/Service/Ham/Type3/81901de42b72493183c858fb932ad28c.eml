Ok. I need for you to fill our the basic information and then I will add
your villa in St Thomas. Then when I have the listing completed I will call
to get your credit card or send an email with a link to a secure server.
Which ever that you prefer.

Create the basic account information starting here.
http://www.vacations-abroad.com/AccountInformation.aspx

Let me know when you get this information completed and then I will add your
property.
