Hi! March is the best skiing in my opinion, not only is the snow typically
great though April but the crowds die down. I recommend renting a car or a
van, other than that you would have to come on a greyhound bus. A 4WD
vehicle is the way to go! We are as close as ski in out as it gets, house is
right in front of Gunbarrel and World Cup Runs. I can offer you a great
early booking rate, regularly it is 2,900 week for this time.I will Discount
it down to 2100, that is only 300nt for a fantastic location(and House).Tax
is 10% and cleaning is 150. IF this may work or if you have any other
questions let me know! Thanks! Chris
