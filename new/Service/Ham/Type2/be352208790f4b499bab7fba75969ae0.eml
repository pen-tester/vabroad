Made it to Singapore. ...
The next day I went to Northwest's desk and asked for the ticket on 
Nippon... told them the flight and everything. They said that the flight 
was completely book and overbooked. 
I asked them to then put me on standby...with Nippon.
The said they would call Nippon, and if approved I would get ticket...and 
within 30 minutes I had my ticket. 
Then I went over Nippon and they issued a real ticket to me... Not a 
standby ticket.
Don't know why someone in Delta in the USA could find the ticket but the 
ticket agents at Northwest could not find it. Their service was lousy.

Nippon or ANA was great... they did not charge for beer and wine... which I 
did not drink... they had TVs for each person....

On northwest, the TV did not work, the light at my seat did not work. Plus 
I missed a day cause someone on the airplane was ill and they made an 
emergency landing.

Oh well, Northwest better improve their service if they expect to stay in 
business..

The Conrad is great!... It is 3am in the morning and they opened the 
business center and did not charge me. Normally there is a charge to use 
the computer.
Tomorrow is a busy day.
Hope things are OK with you.
Linda
