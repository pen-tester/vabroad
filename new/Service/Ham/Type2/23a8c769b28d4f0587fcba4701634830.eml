Hi Julie,
Our system got overloaded and our developer will not be in the office until 
Monday. It should be back up and running then. 
Nothing has happened to your listing. It will be online tomorrow.

I have attempted to access my account and encounter - "Service Unavailable" 
with every attempt.  Are there difficulties with the web site this week?  
My listing is up-to-date with information and payment.

Thank You!
Julie Sanderbeck
