Hi,
Took a taxi tour this morning and then went to the convention.  I am so 
exhausted from the time difference. Feel like chilling out and relaxing.  I 
think last night I only got 4-5 hours of sleep. Dont know if I can keep  my 
eyes open any more.  It is 1pm here but 1 am your time... My body is saying 
"Go to sleep"
It is lonesome here without you.

I am happy you could get on the All Nippon flight. I got the notice from 
Ms.Kaur at the hotel early this morning that you had arrived. I was worried 
that at first they did not have a reservation for you and they might have 
cancelled you since you did not show on time. I did explain what happened 
to your flight and through no fault of your own you were delayed. I also 
advised which flights you might be on. 
  
I hope you enjoy the conference. 
  
Regards,

Made it to Singapore. ...
The next day I went to Northwest's desk and asked for the ticket on 
Nippon... told them the flight and everything. They said that the flight 
was completely book and overbooked. 
I asked them to then put me on standby...with Nippon.
The said they would call Nippon, and if approved I would get ticket...and 
within 30 minutes I had my ticket. 
Then I went over Nippon and they issued a real ticket to me... Not a 
standby ticket.
Don't know why someone in Delta in the USA could find the ticket but the 
ticket agents at Northwest could not find it. Their service was lousy.

Nippon or ANA was great... they did not charge for beer and wine... which I 
did not drink... they had TVs for each person....

On northwest, the TV did not work, the light at my seat did not work. Plus 
I missed a day cause someone on the airplane was ill and they made an 
emergency landing.

Oh well, Northwest better improve their service if they expect to stay in 
business..

The Conrad is great!... It is 3am in the morning and they opened the 
business center and did not charge me. Normally there is a charge to use 
the computer.
Tomorrow is a busy day.
Hope things are OK with you.
Linda
