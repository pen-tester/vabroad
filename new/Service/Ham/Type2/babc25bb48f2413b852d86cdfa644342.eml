Linda,
 
I have sent you two notes via our FB communications.....are you and your 
fellow interested in attending the 
event on Sunday?   I just would hate for you to miss it if you wanted to 
come.......I have offered to add you to my reply and let you know where the 
gathering is once I hear from you.....so far not a peep so I am very 
confused.......
