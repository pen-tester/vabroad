Hello Linda,

I have once again rebooted the VPS so the site is currently up and running. 
Since we are unsure as to what is spawning these mail processes it is 
unclear as to correct the problem. The best solution would be to contact 
your developer as soon as they are available. 

Let us know if there is anything we can do to assist you in the mean time.

Regards,

>Hello Linda,

The only way we have been able to keep the VPS running is my manually 
killing the NewsletterDeploy.exe process each time it spawns. We have been 
unable to determine where the programmer has configured the process to 
continually run, so you should consult with him/her today to determine how 
to tweak the settings of this new mail application. We have no means to 
prevent the process from running without knowing the source which is 
spawning it.
