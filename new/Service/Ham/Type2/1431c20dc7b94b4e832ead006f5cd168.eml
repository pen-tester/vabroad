What exactly is happening? 
We have a new section in the rates, you have to enter a low and high 
nightly rate, 
That information will display on the city page so people can look for 
something that fits their budget.
I would be happy to handle it for you.

Hi, 
  
Our rental property on your website is no. 2262. 
  
I have been trying to update our listing but can't get past Apartment 
Rates.  The site will not accept the rates I put in. Therefore I haven't 
been able to update any of the site.  Can you help please. 
  
I had a look at the Alpharetta city site and you appear to live in a great 
city. I enjoyed the tour around. 
  
Best wishes from Rainbow Beach
 
Judy
