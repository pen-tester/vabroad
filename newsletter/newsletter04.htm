                        <img width="350" align="left" alt="Views of Lake Como italy" src="http://www.vacations-abroad.com/newsletter/PICT1166.jpg" />Lake                Como is considered one of the diamonds in a tiara of lakes found                approximately 30 miles north of Milan. The deepest lake in Europe,                it rests between the granite mountains of the lower Alps, with its                three fingers extending between the mountains as they rise up to                the sky. </font></div>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For                centuries, aristocratic Italians and wealthy families have mingled                at Lake Como, enjoying the temperate climate and the gorgeous scenery                that enhances the presentation of their villas and, at the same                time, their social standing. Even the ancient Romans built villas                here. Pliny the Elder, (23 A.D.&ndash;79 A.D.), a famous historian                and writer, had a villa in Como. Pliny the Younger (61 A.D.&ndash;112                A.D.), a famous military officer and statesman who chronicled the                existing Roman legal system in a series of letters to his friends                and associates, built two villas here. In the 1400s, Leonardo da                Vinci visited Bellagio and Lake Como. Napoleon visited his Grand                Chancellor of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, Francesco Melzi d&rsquo;Eril,                at Villa Melzi in Bellagio.</font></p>

                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One                of the prettiest villages on Lake Como&rsquo;s shore is Bellagio.                The village rests on a promontory that extends into the center of                the lake with a view from all sides; it seems to keep a sleepy watch.                The road to Bellagio begins at the town of Como and weaves up the                peninsula, coming to an end at the village. It is chiseled out of                the sides of the mountains at 90-degree angles, and as you drive                through the mountains, you wish that you were reincarnated as a                mountain goat&mdash;it would be much easier to navigate the roads.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today,                Bellagio is a small village, with cobbled streets that favor foot                traffic. The narrow sidewalks angle upwards into the hills and form                the center of the town. The main promenade stretches along the waterfront,                with the exclusive hotels and quaint cafes facing out towards the                lake. A perfect afternoon can be spent sitting at one of the cafes                with a good book, enjoying the sun. The docks in Bellagion Lake                Como.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img width="250" align="left" alt="Shoreline of Bellagio" src="http://www.vacations-abroad.com/newsletter/PICT1144sm.jpg" />Huge                ferries dock at Bellagio every few minutes, with different itineraries                depending on which village you want to visit that day. The easiest                way to get around the lake is by taking the ferries to the various                villages, which means that you can avoid navigating the winding                trails they call roads. The ferries churn the waters all day long,                unloading the tourists. There are car ferries that can take you                to Menaggio, where you can then drive to Lugano in Switzerland,                or enjoy a leisurely afternoon visiting the villages along the other                shoreline for lunch. Then there are the hydrofoil ferries that make                numerous stops up and down the lake. It&rsquo;s not difficult to                find the ferries or the stands that sell the tickets; they are located                at the shoreline for each of the villages.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lake                Como is well known for the luxurious villas and gardens that are                scattered around its shores. The Versace family, George Clooney                and Richard Branson all have villas here. But theirs aren&rsquo;t                the ones you&rsquo;ll want to explore. With Lake Como&rsquo;s illustrious                history, several villas still remain that offer a glance backward                into another era. Today these villas and their gardens are maintained                as museums and are the major attractions around the lake.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Villa                Balbianello</em></strong></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img width="321" height="295" align="right" alt="Villa Balbianello" src="http://www.vacations-abroad.com/newsletter/PICT1100.jpg" />One                of the most unique (and also one of the oldest) villas on Lake Como                is Villa Balbianello, located in Lenno, built on the site of an                old monastery by Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini during the late 1700s.                The cardinal tried to incorporate elements of the monastery into                the design of his villa. Today, the villa is a living monument to                the life of Count Guido Monzino, an Italian explorer who bought                the villa in 1974. Monzino was the first Italian to climb Mount                Everest; his explorations took him to every continent in the world.                In the villa, he created elaborate Villa Balbianello in Lake Comodisplays                of his collections from his travels. Some rooms are filled with                indigenous art from the Incas of South America to the art of the                Eskimos at the North Pole. Being an Italian did not prevent him                from collecting elaborate French antique furniture from the 1700s                or paintings by English artists who practiced the beautiful art                of reverse painting on glass. Surrounding the villa are intricate                gardens designed to grace the slopes of the hills as they reach                down to the lake.</font></p>

                        <em><strong><font size="3">Villa Carlotta</font></strong></em></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img width="250" align="left" alt="Villa Carlotta" src="http://www.vacations-abroad.com/newsletter/PICT1130.jpg" />Just                down the road in Tremezzo is Villa Carlotta; built by the Clerici,                an aristocratic family from Lombardy in the late 18th century, and                later purchased by a Prussian princess. The villa has a rather imposing                presence as it stretches along the border of the lake. But if you                like gardens, Villa Carlotta has about 20 acres of them. Stepping                inside the gates, you&rsquo;re surrounded by private enclave of                camellias. The main entrance is a typical formal Italian garden                with an enchanting 18th-century fountain of a cherub and dolphin.                A series of terraces and staircases extend upward the villa. As                you walk toward the gardens, you&rsquo;re enveloped by a sense of                serenity and peace. The gardens seem to extend forever; long expanses                of green lawn are lined with exotic and tropical plants. The climate                around Lake Como is very conducive to a variety of gardens because                the temperature very seldom drops below freezing, so many of the                plants collected at Villa Carlotta have been there for centuries.                Tropical palms, redwood trees, azaleas, rhododendron and fern grottos                are all part of the gardens.</font></p>

                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There                are many villas to visit at Lake Como: Villa Cipressi and Villa                Monastero in Varenna, Villa Melzi and Villa Serbelloni in Bellagio,                Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo, Villa Balbianello in Lenno, and Villa                Pizzo and Villa d&rsquo;Este in Cernobbio. Each day, take the hydrofoil                from Bellagio to a different village, visit the villas, enjoy lunch,                and then catch the last ferry back to Bellagio.</font></p>
                        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When                you leave Bellagio, take a car ferry to the other side of the lake,                and drive back along the opposite shore. The ride is more enjoyable.</font></p>
