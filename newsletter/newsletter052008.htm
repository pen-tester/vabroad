                      Como is considered one of the diamonds in a tiara of lakes 
                      found approximately 30 miles north of Milan. The deepest 
                      lake in Europe, it rests between the granite mountains of 
                      the lower Alps, with its three fingers extending between 
                      the mountains as they rise up to the sky.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
                      centuries, aristocratic Italians and wealthy families have 
                      mingled at Lake Como, enjoying the temperate climate and 
                      the gorgeous scenery that enhances the presentation of their 
                      villas and, at the same time, their social standing. Even 
                      the ancient Romans built villas here. Pliny the Elder, (23 
                      A.D.&#8211;79 A.D.), a famous historian and writer, had 
                      a villa in Como. Pliny the Younger (61 A.D.&#8211;112 A.D.), 
                      a famous military officer and statesman who chronicled the 
                      existing Roman legal system in a series of letters to his 
                      friends and associates, built two villas here. In the 1400s, 
                      Leonardo da Vinci visited Bellagio and Lake Como. Napoleon 
                      visited his Grand Chancellor of the Napoleonic Kingdom of 
                      Italy, Francesco Melzi d&#8217;Eril, at Villa Melzi in Bellagio.</font></p>

                      of the prettiest villages on Lake Como&#8217;s shore is 
                      Bellagio. The village rests on a promontory that extends 
                      into the center of the lake with a view from all sides; 
                      it seems to keep a sleepy watch. <img src="/newsletter/PICT1145.jpg" alt="bellagio" width="314" height="251" border="2" align="left">The 
                      road to Bellagio begins at the town of Como and weaves up 
                      the peninsula, coming to an end at the village. It is chiseled 
                      out of the sides of the mountains at 90-degree angles, and 
                      as you drive through the mountains, you wish that you were 
                      reincarnated as a mountain goat&#8212;it would be much easier 
                      to navigate the roads.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, 
                      Bellagio is a small village, with cobbled streets that favor 
                      foot traffic. The narrow sidewalks angle upwards into the 
                      hills and form the center of the town. The main promenade 
                      stretches along the waterfront, with the exclusive hotels 
                      and quaint cafes facing out towards the lake. A perfect 
                      afternoon can be spent sitting at one of the cafes with 
                      a good book, enjoying the sun. The docks in Bellagion Lake

                      ferries dock at Bellagio every few minutes, with different 
                      itineraries depending on which village you want to visit 
                      that day. The easiest way to get around the lake is by taking 
                      the ferries to the various villages, which means that you 
                      can avoid navigating the winding trails they call roads. 
                      The ferries churn the waters all day long, unloading the 
                      tourists. There are car ferries that can take you to Menaggio, 
                      where you can then drive to Lugano in Switzerland, or enjoy 
                      a leisurely afternoon visiting the villages along the other 
                      shoreline for lunch. Then there are the hydrofoil ferries 
                      that make numerous stops up and down the lake. It&#8217;s 
                      not difficult to find the ferries or the stands that sell 
                      the tickets; they are located at the shoreline for each 
                      of the villages.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lake 
                      Como is well known for the luxurious villas and gardens 
                      that are scattered around its shores. The Versace family, 
                      George Clooney and Richard Branson all have villas here. 
                      But theirs aren&#8217;t the ones you&#8217;ll want to explore. 
                      With Lake Como&#8217;s illustrious history, several villas 
                      still remain that offer a glance backward into another era. 
                      Today these villas and their gardens are maintained as museums 
                      and are the major attractions around the lake.</font></p>

                      of the most unique (and also one of the oldest) villas on 
                      Lake Como is Villa Balbianello, located in Lenno, built 
                      on the site of an old monastery by Cardinal Angelo Maria 
                      Durini during the late 1700s. The cardinal tried to incorporate 
                      elements of the monastery into the design of his villa. 
                      Today, the villa is a living monument to the life of Count 
                      Guido Monzino, an Italian explorer who bought the villa 
                      in 1974. Monzino was the first Italian to climb Mount Everest; 
                      his explorations took him to every continent in the world. 
                      In the villa, he created elaborate Villa Balbianello in 
                      Lake Comodisplays of his collections from his travels. Some 
                      rooms are filled with indigenous art from the Incas of South 
                      America to the art of the Eskimos at the North Pole. Being 
                      an Italian did not prevent him from collecting elaborate 
                      French antique furniture from the 1700s or paintings by 
                      English artists who practiced the beautiful art of reverse 
                      painting on glass. Surrounding the villa are intricate gardens 
                      designed to grace the slopes of the hills as they reach 
                      down to the lake.</font></p>

                      down the road in Tremezzo is Villa Carlotta; built by the 
                      Clerici, an aristocratic family from Lombardy in the late 
                      18th century, and later purchased by a Prussian princess. 
                      The villa has a rather imposing presence as it stretches 
                      along the border of the lake. But if you like gardens, Villa 
                      Carlotta has about 20 acres of them. Stepping inside the 
                      gates, you&#8217;re surrounded by private enclave of camellias. 
                      The main entrance is a typical formal Italian garden with 
                      an enchanting 18th-century fountain of a cherub and dolphin. 
                      A series of terraces and staircases extend upward the villa. 
                      As you walk toward the gardens, you&#8217;re enveloped by 
                      a sense of serenity and peace. The gardens seem to extend 
                      forever; long expanses of green lawn are lined with exotic 
                      and tropical plants. The climate around Lake Como is very 
                      conducive to a variety of gardens because the temperature 
                      very seldom drops below freezing, so many of the plants 
                      collected at Villa Carlotta have been there for centuries. 
                      Tropical palms, redwood trees, azaleas, rhododendron and 
                      fern grottos are all part of the gardens.</font></p>

                      Villas</em></strong></font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                      are many villas to visit at Lake Como: Villa Cipressi and 
                      Villa Monastero in Varenna, Villa Melzi and Villa Serbelloni 
                      in Bellagio, Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo, Villa Balbianello 
                      in Lenno, and Villa Pizzo and Villa d&#8217;Este in Cernobbio. 
                      Each day, take the hydrofoil from Bellagio to a different 
                      village, visit the villas, enjoy lunch, and then catch the 
                      last ferry back to Bellagio.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
                      you leave Bellagio, take a car ferry to the other side of 
                      the lake, and drive back along the opposite shore. The ride 
                      is more enjoyable.</font></p>
