                Como Bella Como<br>
                Lake Como is considered one of the diamonds in a tiara of lakes 
                found approximately 30 miles north of Milan. The deepest lake 
                in Europe, it rests between the granite mountains of the lower 
                Alps, with its three fingers extending between the mountains as 
                they rise up to the sky. </div>
              <p align="left">For centuries, aristocratic Italians and wealthy 
                families have mingled at Lake Como, enjoying the temperate climate 
                and the gorgeous scenery that enhances the presentation of their 
                villas and, at the same time, their social standing. Even the 
                ancient Romans built villas here. Pliny the Elder, (23 A.D.&#8211;79 
                A.D.), a famous historian and writer, had a villa in Como. Pliny 
                the Younger (61 A.D.&#8211;112 A.D.), a famous military officer 
                and statesman who chronicled the existing Roman legal system in 
                a series of letters to his friends and associates, built two villas 
                here. In the 1400s, Leonardo da Vinci visited Bellagio and Lake 
                Como. Napoleon visited his Grand Chancellor of the Napoleonic 
                Kingdom of Italy, Francesco Melzi d&#8217;Eril, at Villa Melzi 
                in Bellagio.</p>
              <p align="left">Bellagio Lake Como</p>
              <p align="left">One of the prettiest villages on Lake Como&#8217;s 
                shore is Bellagio. The village rests on a promontory that extends 
                into the center of the lake with a view from all sides; it seems 
                to keep a sleepy watch. The road to Bellagio begins at the town 
                of Como and weaves up the peninsula, coming to an end at the village. 
                It is chiseled out of the sides of the mountains at 90-degree 
                angles, and as you drive through the mountains, you wish that 
                you were reincarnated as a mountain goat&#8212;it would be much 
                easier to navigate the roads.</p>
              <p align="left">Today, Bellagio is a small village, with cobbled 
                streets that favor foot traffic. The narrow sidewalks angle upwards 
                into the hills and form the center of the town. The main promenade 
                stretches along the waterfront, with the exclusive hotels and 
                quaint cafes facing out towards the lake. A perfect afternoon 
                can be spent sitting at one of the cafes with a good book, enjoying 
                the sun. The docks in Bellagion Lake Como.</p>
              <p align="left">Huge ferries dock at Bellagio every few minutes, 
                with different itineraries depending on which village you want 
                to visit that day. The easiest way to get around the lake is by 
                taking the ferries to the various villages, which means that you 
                can avoid navigating the winding trails they call roads. The ferries 
                churn the waters all day long, unloading the tourists. There are 
                car ferries that can take you to Menaggio, where you can then 
                drive to Lugano in Switzerland, or enjoy a leisurely afternoon 
                visiting the villages along the other shoreline for lunch. Then 
                there are the hydrofoil ferries that make numerous stops up and 
                down the lake. It&#8217;s not difficult to find the ferries or 
                the stands that sell the tickets; they are located at the shoreline 
                for each of the villages.</p>
              <p align="left">Lake Como is well known for the luxurious villas 
                and gardens that are scattered around its shores. The Versace 
                family, George Clooney and Richard Branson all have villas here. 
                But theirs aren&#8217;t the ones you&#8217;ll want to explore. 
                With Lake Como&#8217;s illustrious history, several villas still 
                remain that offer a glance backward into another era. Today these 
                villas and their gardens are maintained as museums and are the 
                major attractions around the lake.</p>
              <p align="left">Villa Balbianello</p>
              <p align="left">One of the most unique (and also one of the oldest) 
                villas on Lake Como is Villa Balbianello, located in Lenno, built 
                on the site of an old monastery by Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini 
                during the late 1700s. The cardinal tried to incorporate elements 
                of the monastery into the design of his villa. Today, the villa 
                is a living monument to the life of Count Guido Monzino, an Italian 
                explorer who bought the villa in 1974. Monzino was the first Italian 
                to climb Mount Everest; his explorations took him to every continent 
                in the world. In the villa, he created elaborate Villa Balbianello 
                in Lake Comodisplays of his collections from his travels. Some 
                rooms are filled with indigenous art from the Incas of South America 
                to the art of the Eskimos at the North Pole. Being an Italian 
                did not prevent him from collecting elaborate French antique furniture 
                from the 1700s or paintings by English artists who practiced the 
                beautiful art of reverse painting on glass. Surrounding the villa 
                are intricate gardens designed to grace the slopes of the hills 
                as they reach down to the lake.</p>
              <p align="left"><br>
                Villa Carlotta</p>
              <p align="left">Just down the road in Tremezzo is Villa Carlotta; 
                built by the Clerici, an aristocratic family from Lombardy in 
                the late 18th century, and later purchased by a Prussian princess. 
                The villa has a rather imposing presence as it stretches along 
                the border of the lake. But if you like gardens, Villa Carlotta 
                has about 20 acres of them. Stepping inside the gates, you&#8217;re 
                surrounded by private enclave of camellias. The main entrance 
                is a typical formal Italian garden with an enchanting 18th-century 
                fountain of a cherub and dolphin. A series of terraces and staircases 
                extend upward the villa. As you walk toward the gardens, you&#8217;re 
                enveloped by a sense of serenity and peace. The gardens seem to 
                extend forever; long expanses of green lawn are lined with exotic 
                and tropical plants. The climate around Lake Como is very conducive 
                to a variety of gardens because the temperature very seldom drops 
                below freezing, so many of the plants collected at Villa Carlotta 
                have been there for centuries. Tropical palms, redwood trees, 
                azaleas, rhododendron and fern grottos are all part of the gardens.</p>
              <p align="left">Other Villas</p>
              <p align="left">There are many villas to visit at Lake Como: Villa 
                Cipressi and Villa Monastero in Varenna, Villa Melzi and Villa 
                Serbelloni in Bellagio, Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo, Villa Balbianello 
                in Lenno, and Villa Pizzo and Villa d&#8217;Este in Cernobbio. 
                Each day, take the hydrofoil from Bellagio to a different village, 
                visit the villas, enjoy lunch, and then catch the last ferry back 
                to Bellagio.</p>
              <p align="left">When you leave Bellagio, take a car ferry to the 
                other side of the lake, and drive back along the opposite shore. 
                The ride is more enjoyable.</p>
